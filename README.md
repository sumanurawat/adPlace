In recent years, owing to the ever-increasing consumer base of video content over the internet, promot- ing business via advertising between the videos has become a powerful strategy. Mid roll ads are the video ads that are played between the content of a video being watched by the user.

This is done using emotion, text, action, audio and video analysis of different scenes of a video under consideration.
